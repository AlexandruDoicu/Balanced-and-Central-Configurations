# Balanced and Central Configuration Viewer

The pre-built version of the viewer is located in the "compiled_version" folder. The following steps are necessary to run the viewer:
1. Download the "compiled_version" directory.
2. Open the terminal in which the "CCBCView" file is located together with the "Configurations" and "SavedPlots" directories.
3. Enter the command "sudo 'path-to-the-file-CCBCView'" in the terminal.

The source files of the configuration viewer are located in the "source" directory. The viewer was written in C++ using the Qt library for designing the GUI. In order to built it move the foldes "Configuration" and "SavedPlots" into your built directory.
